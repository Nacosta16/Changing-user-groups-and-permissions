# Changing users and groups

   <H> Knowing how to manage user groups in Active Directory as an IT admin is important for security, efficiency, and compliance. It ensures users have the right access without assigning permissions individually. Groups make it easy to update access when employees change roles, reducing security risks and human errors! </H>
